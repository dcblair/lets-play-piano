# Let's Play Piano!

## Motivation
Let's Play Piano comes from one perhaps the most important aspect of my life, music.
Learning music provides me with joyâ€” as does teaching it. Let's Learn Piano offers a fun
way to understand the layout of a piano's keys and learn how to play it.

## Credits
I would like to thank Jacob for all of his help refactoring code to enable optimal execution. Jacob helped me understand the intricacies of setting intervals, as well as using recursion.


## Future Development
Let's Play Piano's successor will offer a catalog of songs, multiple tempos allowing for increased or relaxed levels of difficulty, and a more dynamic and interactive interface.
