# Let's Play Piano!
Play piano using your computer keyboard!

## Motivation
Let's Play Piano comes from one of the most important aspects of my life, music.
Learning music provides me with an irreplaceable joyâ€” as does teaching it. Let's Learn Piano offers a fun
way to understand the layout of a piano's keys and learn how to play it.

## User Stories
* Press the start button to begin game
  - After pressing, the start button becomes a restart button
* The interface features a 13-key piano that can be played with the user's computer keyboard,
the score box towards the top right, a "volume slider", and the range in the center
* Once the game starts an image of a computer key with a letter on it appears over the game range
* The key moves across screen from left to right
* Watch as the key moves towards the green threshold of range
* Pressing the corresponding letter key on the keyboard when the image is within the green zone wins points
* Pressing the incorrect key, or pressing the correct key while the key image is not in the green zone will lose points
* When the song ends, the user is alerted:
  - Positive points will provide a winning message
  - Negative points will provide a losing message

## Technologies & Code Snippets
* Javascript
* CSS
* HTML
* Below is my favorite piece of code. Although it is a large chunk of code,
it exemplifies a major turning point in coding Let's Play Piano. This is the
logic that controls the point gauging system, as well as the iterating of
key images.
  - document.querySelector(".range").appendChild(game.mary[this.index])
    game.mary[this.index].classList.add("key-pressed");
    game.currKeyImg = game.mary[this.index].alt;
    this.index++;
    let moveTime = 0;
    let interval = setInterval(function(e) { 
      if (moveTime === 5000) { 
      clearInterval(interval);
      let el = document.querySelector(".key-pressed")
      el.parentNode.removeChild(el)
      game.sweetSpot = false;
      if (game.index < game.mary.length) {
        game.moveKey()
      } else {
        game.win();
      }
      } else if (moveTime > 200 && moveTime < 2000) {
        console.log("sweet spot")
        moveTime+= 500
        game.sweetSpot = true;
        game.mary[this.index].classList.add("correct-key");
      } else {
        moveTime+= 500
        game.sweetSpot = false;
      }
    }, 500)
  },

I would like to thank Jacob for all of his help refactoring code to enable optimal execution. Jacob helped me understand the intricacies of setting intervals, as well as using recursion.


## Future Development
Let's Play Piano's successor will offer a catalog of songs, multiple tempos allowing for increased or relaxed levels of difficulty, and a more dynamic and interactive interface.
